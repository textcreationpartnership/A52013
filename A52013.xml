            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The ſpirit of God directs you to a meane in mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which will beſt ſute with your ſables, that is, to <hi>weepe as if you wept not.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.30.</note> So you ſhall ſhew your love by your teares, and your faith by your moderation.</p>
            <p>And truly <hi>Sir,</hi> amongſt the moſt I know, you have leaſt cauſe to exceed in ſorrowes for the death of your deare conſort: if you pleaſe ſeriouſly to conſider, how that nothing deplorable or grievous hath befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len her, more than what hath commonly happened to beleevers, while in the meane time, God wonderfully manifeſted his goodneſſe in ſundry remarkable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies towards her, which hee hath ofttimes withheld from many of his choyſeſt children. That ſhe dyed, that ſhe dyed young, that ſhe dyed a ſtranger in this Kingdome; that ſhe was troubled with ſome doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings before; and that ſhe hath left you deſtitute ſince her death, as it is all you can object to miniſter mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of griefe unto you, ſo let me aſſure you, that there is no particular of it, either new or ſtrange.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As for death, <hi>Debemur morti nos noſtraque.</hi> It is as good a debt as any the world knowes, for the levying whereof there is an extent upon all mankind, and a ſtatute enacted <hi>primo Adami,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb 9, 27.</note> and recorded by S. <hi>Paul, Statutum eſt omnibus ſemel mori, It is appointed for all men once to dye.</hi> Hence <hi>homo</hi> (a common name to all men) is <hi>ex humo</hi> from the ground, and <hi>Adam</hi> ſignifies but Red Earth, of which both the Prince and the Peaſant
<pb facs="tcp:45717:3"/>are alike Elemented. And though there be diverſities amongſt us while wee live, ſome like <hi>Nabuchadnezer</hi> have golden heads, and ſome like <hi>Chryſostome</hi> have gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den tongues, yet we all ſtand <hi>luteis pedibus,</hi> on ſeet of clay, for ſo ſayes the Prophet,<note place="margin">Dan. 2.32.33.</note> 
               <hi>What man is he that ſhall not ſee death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And though long life be accounted a bleſſing, yet is not a ſhort life to bee eſteemed a curſe, ſince God conferres length of dayes to ſome (ſayes S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>) to ſhew that they are his gift, and denyes them to other, ſome that we may know how that he hath better gifts than this: yet cannot he by this deny all be ſaid more to breake promiſe with his people (when for a long life on earth, he payes with an eternall life in heaven) then <hi>Herod</hi> with <hi>Herodias</hi> if (promiſing but the halfe) he had given her the whole Kingdome. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, whom God loves hee dy's young, ſaid <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nander:</hi> God (whom hee makes moſt account of) thoſe he ſooneſt taketh, ſaid <hi>Euripides;</hi> and <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> tells us, <hi>hoc nobis adfert longius vitae ſpatium, quòd plura mala partim videmus, partim perpetramus, partim ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinemus,</hi> This is all the benefit of long life, to ſee more evill, ſuffer more ſorrow, and commit more ſin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nor was ſhe the onely ſtranger who departed this life remote from her native Countrey. <hi>Adam</hi> her firſt Father by generation,<note place="margin">Heb 11.9. 1 Pet 3.6.</note> and <hi>Abraham</hi> her faithfull Father by regeneration, (whoſe daughter ſhe was made <hi>by doing well,</hi> ſayes <hi>S. Peter</hi>) dyed both in a ſtrange land. So that if you begin with <hi>David</hi> to complaine and ſay <hi>ſhe was a ſtranger,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 39.12.</note> you muſt add moreover, <hi>as were all her Fathers,</hi> &amp; then the ſtrangeneſſe will be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and with it your complaint alſo. Trees tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
<pb facs="tcp:45717:4"/>ofttimes become more fruitfull, and ſo did ſhe: whom God perceiving to beare ſo well, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into his Celeſtiall Paradiſe, where being plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (as ſaith the Pſalmiſt) in the houſe of the Lord, ſhe ſhall <hi>for ever floriſh in the Courts of our God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſ 92.13.</note> and grow greene to eternity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And as for her doubtings, they may the more confirme your aſſurance of her happineſſe, for the Divell never makes warre againſt thoſe of his owne kingdome, who are as ſecurely his owne as temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can make them: thoſe whom he tempts to doubts and deſpayre are ſuch whom himſelfe doubts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpayres of.<note place="margin">Luke 11.21.</note> Our Saviour tells you, <hi>while the ſtrong man armed keeps the houſe, the things which hee poſſeſſeth are in peace;</hi> but when Satan aſſaults the Fort without, it is a certaine ſigne hee is not yet within, nor hath any command of that Caſtle which he holds not in quiet obedience.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Beſides, you are not the firſt in this kind of loſſe:<note place="margin">Gen. 23.2. Gen. 35.19.</note> thus <hi>Abraham</hi> was forced to forgoe his <hi>Sarah,</hi> thus <hi>Iacob</hi> his <hi>Rachel:</hi> others have had their ſhare in the like ſorrowes, and company is ſome comfort though it be in miſery. <hi>Demonax</hi> the Philoſopher ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one immoderatly to bewayl the death of a friend, he wiſhed him in a great multitude, to looke about if he could find one man exempted from the like acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which fayling to doe community in the caſe returned him better compoſed.</p>
            <p>And as theſe arguments are prevalent to mit igate your griefe, ſo are there others as equivalent to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote your comfort. How many have there beene of Gods deare children, who have gone out of the world
<pb facs="tcp:45717:4"/>(as <hi>Iſrael</hi> went out of <hi>Egypt</hi>) in haſt, having their lives ſnatched from them by the hand of ſudden death, while God gave unto your beloved wife, time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and preparation? How many whoſe Sun of ſaving aſſurance hath even ſet in a cloud of doubts, and diſtruſt full thoughts, (for ought that hath beene viſible in our Horizon) while God reſtored her to the joy of his ſalvation, to both your great rejoycings, making her to ſay with the Prophet,<note place="margin">Pſal. 94.19.</note> In the multitude of the ſorrowes that I had in my heart, thy comforts have refreſhed my ſoule. How many through the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of their diſeaſes, have beene diſſolved on ſuch diſtempered and diſtracted fits, that Charity her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath been faine to looke backe, and take a view of their lives, before ſhe durſt paſſe her verdit of their deaths. When her diſſolution was ſo cheerefull and Chriſtian-like, that whoſoever had beheld it (though unacquainted with her life) yet muſt needs have given her that teſtimony which the <hi>Centurion</hi> gave our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour:<note place="margin">Math. 27.54.</note> Surely <hi>this was the child of God.</hi> How comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably may you recount Gods goodneſſe towards her at the very point of her departure, both for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and the time of it, not ſo much as faltering in her ſpeech, nor fayling in any of her intellectualls, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others have done, but continuing all in their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vigour, while ſhe continued her life. S. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Revel. 1.10.</note> is ſaid <hi>on the Lords day to be in the ſpirit,</hi> and ſhe on the Lords day reſigned her ſpirit, and that in a moſt memorable inſtant: for no ſooner were you &amp; your friends retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from commending your owne ſelves to God in the Church, but you were immediatly called to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend her ſoule to God, from the Chamber, ſo
<pb facs="tcp:45717:5"/>where you ended your Sabbath of temporall reſt there ſhe began her Sabbath of eternall reſt. And I may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay,<note place="margin">Exod. 8.19.</note> 
               <hi>digitus Dei hic eſt,</hi> the finger of God was in it, or to ſpeake in the Prophets phraſe, <hi>this was the Lords doing,</hi>

               <hi>and it was marvailous in our eyes.</hi> Suffer me then to comfort you, as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> did <hi>Heliodorus, Ne doleas quod talem amiſeris, ſed gaudeas quod talem habueris,</hi> ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row not ſo much that you have now loſt, as give thanks to God, that once you had ſo vertuous a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion who lived ſo piouſly, and dyed ſo peaceably. And you may alſo comfort your ſelfe (in the abſence of her, your ſelfe united) in the words of <hi>David,</hi> for the death of his child himſelfe divided. <hi>You ſhall goe to her,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.23.</note> 
               <hi>ſhe ſhall not returne to you.</hi> And that you may aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly follow her, to thoſe joyes whither ſhe is gone before and already entred: Be it your care, while you trafficke in this troubleſome world, to imitate that wiſe Merchant in the Goſpell to purſue and purchaſe that one <hi>pearl of inestimable price,</hi>

            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Iohn. 11.25.

            <p>Wherein I ſhall ſhew you both what is meant by dayes, and how they are to be numbred.</p>
            <p>By dayes, in Scripture are ſignified two things.</p>

            <p>Firſt, our thoughts, by embracing the Prophets leſſon,<note place="margin">Ier. 4.14.</note> 
               <hi>ſuffer not a vaine thought to lodge in thee.</hi> Sinne may, nay, will oftentimes viſite us as a ſtranger, or traveller 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.4. but wee muſt in no caſe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine him as a friend to dwell with us, no not ſo much as in the thought, but we muſt labour to kill it in the Conception, to cruſh the Cocatrice while it is in the ſhell,<note place="margin">Pſ. 137.9.</note>

            <p>Secondly, our words which muſt have theſe three properties, few ſeaſonable, and waighty remembring that wee muſt give an account for every idle word,<note place="margin">Matth. 12.36.</note> and therefore to embrace the Apoſtles precept to have our ſpeech always with grace ſeaſoned with ſalt,<note place="margin">Col. 4 6.</note> Conſidering that while thy word is in thy breaſt it is thine own to correct, but once uttered it is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

            <p>Thirdly, our Actions; In the Legall ſacrifices amongſt many other things, they were enjoyned to offer the Turtle, and amongſt many other Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies obſerved this was on, that they wrung off the head of it backward.

Titus Veſpaſian</hi> would tell his friends <hi>(Amici, diem per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didi)</hi> hee had loſt a day when hee had done no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable act in it. <hi>Apelles</hi> being asked how hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo famous in his Art of Picture-drawing, anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered, <hi>Nulla dies ſine linea,</hi> that bee never miſt a day, but hee drew ſomewhat for the improvement of his skill: If wee will bee perfect, wee muſt daily practiſe the way to perfection. The Heathens were ſo caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in the employment of this time, that they deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Jewes, thinking that they loſt every Sabbath day on which they reſted. And it is to be feared that many of us looſe it indeed, or rather our ſelves on it; when reſting from our bodily labour, wee reſt not from ſinne and wickedneſſe even on the Lords day. <hi>Non quam diu, ſed quàm benè;</hi> God doth not ſo much reſpect how long as how well wee live: Nor doth he account of any time more, then what is ſpent in his ſervice. Hence <hi>Philo</hi> calls an old ſinner <hi>Longaevus puer,</hi> and another calls him <hi>Elementarius ſenex,</hi> an old child, one that was never other but a child, who when for his age, he is come even to the brinke of the <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> of death, and expects to paſſe into <hi>Canaan,</hi> is ſent backe againe to dye in the wilderneſſe of <hi>Sinne,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his ignorance and unbeliefe. One told his friend that hee perceived him to decline ſo faſt, that he thought he could not live above a yeare, to whom
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45717:11"/>hee replyed, that if he was ſure to live one yeare, hee would make it two; and being demanded how, hee anſwered by doubling his care in Gods ſervice, who numbers our dayes by our diligence: and indeed this is the way, though wee live but a while on earth, yet to live long in Gods account: not onely <hi>to number our dayes,</hi> but <hi>ſic</hi> ſo <hi>to number them as to apply our hearts, &amp;c.</hi> Which brings in the third particular.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Now God in all our ſacred performances hath eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall reſpect unto this, preferring the manner of the doing of them before the matter it ſelfe: hence he is ſaid to bee better pleaſed with Adverbs, then with Adjectives, <hi>non quam bonum, ſed quam benè;</hi> God never accounts that for good, which is not well done. It is not therefore enough to pray, but we muſt <hi>ſo</hi> pray as to bee heard; Not enough to heare, but wee muſt <hi>ſo</hi> heare as to profit; Not enough to believe, but wee muſt <hi>ſo</hi> believe as to bee ſaved; Not enough to run, but wee muſt <hi>ſo</hi> run as to obtaine; not enough to number our dayes, but we muſt <hi>ſo</hi> number them as to apply &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now there are ſix rules teaching us ſo to number our dayes; taken from the practiſe of ordinary Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticke: The</p>
            <p>Firſt, is knowledge, he that goes about to caſt an account muſt know his rules, how to number, how to divide, how to multiply, how to ſubſtract, &amp;c. Elſe when he hath caſt up his ſummes, he cannot tell, whether they be done right or wrong, and containe more or leſſe. In like manner who ſo will number his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45717:11"/>dayes, muſt have knowledge of the Rules to number by: Now there are,</p>
            <p>Two rules, by which all men living number their dayes, <hi>viz.</hi> a rule of Folly, and a rule of Wiſdome.</p>
            <p>The wicked and ungodly, number by the rule of folly, they by looking upon death at the wrong end of the perſpective, thinke it to be farther off, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is; and their dayes to bee more then they prove to be; and ſo ſecure themſelves in ſinne,<note place="margin">Matth 25.5.8.10</note> till in a moment they are taken away. By this rule the Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Virgins numbred their dayes, thinking the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome would not come ſo ſoone, they ſlept out their oyle, and neglected to buy more, till <hi>Chriſt</hi> came, and found them unprepared, and ſo they were ſhut out. Thus the evill ſervant in the Goſpell numbered,<note place="margin">Luke 12.45 46.</note> &amp;c. When ſuppoſing his Maſter would ſtill delay his coming, he began to beate his fellow ſervants, and to eate and drinke with the drunken, till his <hi>Maſter came, in an houre that he was not aware of,</hi> and cut him off, and gave him his portion with the Hypocrits, &amp;c. Thus the rich Glutton numbred, &amp;c.<note place="margin">Luke 12.18.19.20.</note> 
               <hi>Soule take thine eaſe, thou haſt goods layd up for many dayes, &amp;c.</hi> when that night his ſoule was taken from him.</p>
            <p>The good and godly, they number their dayes, by the rule of Wiſdome, which conſiſts in the ſerious conſideration of three things.<note place="margin">Pſal. 39.6.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Of the vanity of mans life: ſo vayne that it will not admit of any extenuation, being compared in Scripture to things of (ſmalleſt if) no account,<note place="margin">Pſal 102.11.</note> as to a dreame to a ſhadow, to graſle, to a weavers ſhutle, to a ſhepheards tent, to a Bubble,<note place="margin">Eſay 40.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. Of the Brevity of mans life.

               <hi>the Sun ſtood ſtill</hi> at the prayer of <hi>Ioſuah;</hi> and went not downe in one whole day, and yet then at that inſtant the life of man went a dayes journey forward. Admit that of the Pſalmiſt,<note place="margin">Pſ. 90.10.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> that the dayes of our age are three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore yeares and ten, which can be granted, but by way of ſuppoſition, for where one attaines unto it, three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ten, threeſcore and ten times told goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; yet I ſay admit it: and then hee that knowes how to number theſe dayes, by the rule of Wiſdom, can tell you, how that halfe of theſe yeares, by the rule of diviſion, are loſt in ſleepe: there remaines then but 35. whereof 15. at leaſt by the rule of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction muſt alſo be taken away for our childhood, wherein wee were ignorant how to glorify God, or help our ſelves aright; then remaines but 20. yeares, which being joyned by the rule of Multiplication, to our troubles, ſickneſſes, ſorrowes, neceſſary cares, &amp;c. ſo often multiplyed upon us, tell me (if God account of no time but what is ſpent in his ſervice, if what the Philoſopher ſpake of man be not true: that his life is but a day ſong, Nay, if what the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſpake be not true alſo,<note place="margin">Pſ 36.6.</note> that this day is <hi>but a ſpan long.</hi>

               <hi>If the good man of the houſe knew at what time the thiefe would come, he would watch</hi> (ſayes our Saviour,) and not ſuffer himſelfe to bee ſurprized: nor his houſe to be broken up; our bodyes are the houſe, our ſoules the prize, death the theefe, and becauſe thou knoweſt not at what houre hee will come, watch every houre. <hi>Ideo obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur unus, ut obſerventur multi,</hi> ſaid <hi>S. Auſtin,</hi> God hath therefore conceal'd from thee, that one day of thy death; that thou mighteſt ſo expect it every day. The Antients perſwaded to this care by this fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar inſtance: Hadſt thou ſeven ſervants, and wert fully aſcertained that at ſome time, or other, one of them would kill thee, but which or when thou couldſt not tell, wouldſt thou not be very cautelous of them all, and very carefull of giving any of them any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage? why now remember thy life is but a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of ſeven dayes, and one of theſe will kill thee, but which of theſe, or when, becauſe thou knoweſt not, thou oughteſt to be prepared on all of them. Let not the thought of thy laſt end, bee the laſt end of thy thought, but foreſee this Baſiliske
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45717:13"/>death in time, ſo ſhalt thou prevent the danger.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Rule for the ſo numbring, &amp;c. is Intention, a man that goes about to caſt an account, muſt mind it, and intend it as hee goes in order, elſe if he forget any of his ſummes, or omit any of his rules, he muſt beginne againe, all before is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. So muſt every Chriſtian be diligent, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in this his ſpirituall Arithmeticke, and minde this duty of <hi>numbring his dayes,</hi> with all circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: a man that mindes one thing ſo much, that he forgets another, wee ſay in our uſuall phraſe, that he is out of his numbers, the like may bee ſaid of thoſe who are ſo much given to number their earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they forget their heavenly eſtate. I ſpeake not this to with-hold any man from a moderate care to provide neceſſaries for this life, No; <hi>Hee that doth it not is worſe than an Infidell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 11.19.</note> ſayes Saint <hi>Paul. Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> may dwell together: <hi>Chriſt</hi> would have us to bee <hi>wiſe as ſerpents,</hi> if withall wee bee <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent as Doves.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 10.16.</note> The thing I diſſwade is, that we ſuffer not the ſerpent to eate up the Dove, nor <hi>Martha</hi> to turne <hi>Mary</hi> out of doores, that our overmuch care for the world make us not negligent of heaven: a Chriſtian ſhould imitate the Dolphin which, is ſaid to ſwimme, with one eye on the waters, and the other looking on the skye; ſo muſt hee have an eye to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in providing for his ſoule in the ſight of God,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.21.</note> and an eye to the earth in providing <hi>things honeſt in the ſight of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 The third Rule: They that caſt an account, they beginne with the leaſt figures firſt, and ſo proceed from units to tennes from tennes to hundreds, from
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45717:13"/>hundreds to thouſands, &amp;c. So in our <hi>numbring of our dayes,</hi> though at firſt, our knowledge of God be but ſmall, yet let us goe on, and it will multiply like <hi>good ſeed in good ground, in ſome</hi> 30. <hi>in ſome</hi> 60.<note place="margin">Math. 13.8.</note> 
               <hi>in ſome</hi> 100. <hi>fold,</hi> the way of vertue is like the Rocke to <hi>Ionathan,</hi> and his armour-bearer, hard to clyme,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 14.13.14.</note> but victory at the top, or like the Greek T, and Roman Y, narrow at the bottome, but as wee aſcend they branch out: So will Gods gifts increaſe, if wee uſe them well,<note place="margin">Ezek. 47.3.4.</note> grace is like <hi>Ezekiells</hi> waters which <hi>did riſe more and more</hi> till they came up to the head, or like our Saviours wheat which grew more and more,<note place="margin">Mark 4.27.28.</note> till it came to the Harveſt. <hi>Samuel</hi> was dedicated to the Lord from his youth, but it was obſerved of him, that the elder hee grew, the more zealous hee was in his courſe, thus ſhould old men be, and all men too, <hi>quo ſeniores eo ſanctiores.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cantator Cignus funeris ipſe ſui:</hi> was ſaid of a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent man, that like the Swan, the neerer his death, the ſweeter he ſung, the more heavenly his Meditations. Chriſtians ſhould bee like Rivers, which the neerer they come to the Sea, the ſwifter they runne; and it ſhould be ſaid of them as of the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> Their <hi>latter end ſhould be better then their first.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Revel. 1.19.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth Rule. They that caſt accounts begin at the left hand, and proceed to the right; ſo muſt we in the numbring of our dayes. All men number, but the wicked begin at the right hand, <hi>viz.</hi> in prayſing their good deeds, boaſting of their gifts, and glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Creatures of God by them abuſed, but end at the left hand of Gods diſpleaſure.<note place="margin">Luke 18.11.</note> Thus the Phariſee numbred, <hi>God I thanke thee, I am not as other
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45717:14"/>men are,</hi> beginning at the right hand, but hee ended at the left, for the text ſayes, he went away not juſtified. Thus <hi>Dives</hi> began to number at the right hand in <hi>purple and fine linnen</hi> and delicious fare,<note place="margin">Luke 16.19.</note> but ended at the left in hell. Thus they number that cry, <hi>Let us eate and drinke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.32.</note> 
               <hi>for to morrow wee ſhall dye,</hi> ſaying with the wicked, fill us more wine, and we will ſatisfy our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves with ſtrong drinke,<note place="margin">Eſay 56.12.</note> 
               <hi>and to morrow ſhall bee as to day, and much more abundant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the godly beginne at the left hand, mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſorrowing for their ſinnes, and end at the right hand of Gods favour:<note place="margin">Luke 18.13.</note> Thus the Publican <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred his dayes</hi> beginning at the left hand, <hi>God be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto me a ſinner,</hi> and ended at the right hand, <hi>hee went,</hi> ſayes the text, <hi>unto his houſe juſtified.</hi> Thus Saint <hi>Paul</hi> numbred,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.13.</note> beginning at the left hand; I was a perſecutor, &amp;c. but ending at right, <hi>I found mercy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I did it ignorantly.</hi> Thus <hi>Polycarpus</hi> numbred his dayes, when going to his ſufferings, he was told, if hee would ſweare by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and rayle at <hi>Chriſt,</hi> hee ſhould be ſpared; he anſwered, theſe foureſcore and odd yeares have I ſerved him, and found him my good Maſter, and I will not now deny him. Thus S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> taught his charge to <hi>number their dayes,</hi> to caſt up how many houres there were in the weeke, <hi>viz.</hi> 168. and to bee carefull, that God had his due out of them, <hi>viz.</hi> all the houres of the ſeventh day, and ſome houres of every day.</p>
            <p>The fift Rule: They that caſt an account, muſt know the place of every figure, for what it ſtands. So muſt we know, and try our ſelves, in what place wee ſtand in Gods ſervice, according to his talents given
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45717:14"/>to us. No man muſt ſtand as a cipher; if hee doe, God will ſo eſteeme him. The Lacedemonians did uſe to decline their military men through three tenſes of the Indicative Mood, in the firſt Ranck or Chorus came the old worne Souldiers, whoſe ſtrength was ſpent, and their word was <hi>Fuimus,</hi> we have beene valiant in our time: in the ſecond, came the luſty young gallants, and their word was <hi>Sumus,</hi> wee are valiant, try who dare; and in the third came the children, whoſe word was <hi>Erimus,</hi> wee ſhall bee valiant if wee live to it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the old verſe, <hi>Vota ſenum, conſulta virorum, facta juventae.</hi> Let young men bee valiant in action, midle age men in conſultation, old men in devotion, God allowes no man to live without ſome calling,<note place="margin">Gen. 3 19.</note> 
               <hi>In the ſweat of thy browes,</hi> or of thy braynes, thou muſt eate thy bread.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, they that caſt an account, though they ſet never ſo many ciphers together, yet if they have no figure before them, they ſtand for nothing: but add but one figure in the firſt place, and that will give them all their ſeverall quantities, and make the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers to be great ſummes.</p>
            <p>In like manner all wee poſſeſſe are but ciphers, unleſſe <hi>Christ</hi> bee preferred before them. It is hee that gives the bleſſing and the comfortable uſe of what wee have: without <hi>Chriſt,</hi> beauty is but vanity: wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome but folly: ſtrength but infirmity: and riches but miſery. <hi>Ideo malus faelix putatur quia quid ſit faeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citas ignoratur,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> worldly men are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted happy by none but ſuch who know not what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyneſſe is. The whole world without <hi>Chriſt</hi> is but a bare cipher which it properly reſembles, and cannot
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45717:15"/>profit in the day of wrath, for <hi>Chriſt</hi> tells us ſo much: <hi>What will it profit a man to gaine the whole world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Marke 8.36.</note> 
               <hi>and to loſe his owne ſoule?</hi> But place <hi>Chriſt</hi> before it, and then every creature in it ſhall be avaylable for our good: And <hi>Chriſt</hi> aſſures us this too,<note place="margin">Matth. 6.33.</note> 
               <hi>firſt ſeeke the Kingdom of God and the righteouſnes thereof, and all other things ſhall bee added unto you.</hi> So then the way to be truely great, is to bee truely good, vertue is the beſt Nobility, Chriſtianity the greateſt dignity, and godlineſſe the ſureſt gaine. Let it bee then our chiefe labour, <hi>So to number our dayes,</hi> ſince it will both ſupply our houſes with wealth, and apply our hearts to wiſdome, which brings me to the laſt particular, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">

               </label> 
               <hi>Finis,</hi> the End, why wee deſire to bee ſo taught: <hi>That we may apply our hearts to wiſdome.</hi> Wherein ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve firſt, What kind of wiſdome this is. Secondly, how our hearts are ſaid to bee applyed unto it.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, there are two ſorts of wiſdome, as Heady wiſdome, and Hearty wiſdome; Earthly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and Heavenly wiſdome: <hi>Marthas</hi> wiſdome, and <hi>Maryes</hi> wiſdome.</p>
            <p>Now were wee ever to live in this world, <hi>Marthas</hi> wiſdome would be preferred, but ſince our dayes are numbred with God, <hi>Maryes</hi> choyce will beſt teach us ſo to number them our ſelves as <hi>to apply our hearts to heavenly wiſdome.</hi> Which may be diſtinguiſhed from the earthly in 4. particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the Object: The Object of heavenly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is made unto us, <hi>Wiſdome, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, ſanctification and redemption.</hi> 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.30. But of earthly wiſdome, vanity and ſinne.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By the Properties: Heavenly wiſdome is pure,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45717:15"/>peaceable, gentle and eaſy to be intreated, full of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and good fruits, without partiality and without Hypocriſy. <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.17. But earthly wiſdome is mixt with ſin, mudded with luſt, cruell, crafty, and quarel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.15.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By the Schoole where they are to bee learnt, Heavenly wiſdome is taught onely of God, by his Spirit, and in his Word; but the other hath as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Maſters as there are corrupt mindes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By the end at which they aime. The one tends chiefely to the good of the ſoule, howſoever it fare with the body: But the other chiefely to ſatisfy, and fulfill the luſts of the fleſh without reſpect unto the ſoule: Let an earthly wiſe man have <hi>Eſaus</hi> bleſſing,<note place="margin">Gen. 27.39.28.</note> 
               <hi>the fatneſſe of the earth,</hi> and let who will take <hi>Iacobs</hi> bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>the dew of Heaven.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 4.8.</note> Let <hi>their corne and wine and oyle increaſe;</hi> it is all they care for, as for the light of Gods countenance, they regard it not.</p>
            <p>For the Second, hee that beleeves what God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes, applyes his heart to faith: Hee that does what God commands, applyes his heart to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and hee that makes uſe of both theſe in their benefits, and effects to the good of his ſoule, applyes his heart to wiſdome.</p>
            <p>Now, hee that will ſo number his dayes as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore layd downe, muſt thus apply his heart to a ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold wiſdome.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to the <hi>Virgins Wiſdome,</hi> the wiſdome of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration <hi>Math.</hi> 25.4. <hi>The wiſe Virgins tooke oyle in their Veſſells:</hi> Wee all know the Bridegroome <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> will come, but when wee know not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought alwayes to bee prepared with the oyle
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45717:16"/>of grace in our lamps, that when hee ſhall come, we may be ready, <hi>to enter with him,</hi> into his everlaſting glory. I find no other difference betwixt the wiſe Virgins and the fooliſh, but onely this; the one did that in time, which the other would faine have done when it was too late. If thou bee wiſe then: prepare in time, leaſt thou repent when it is too late.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to the <hi>ſerpents wiſdome,</hi> the wiſdome of Preſervation. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.16. <hi>Bee yee wiſe as ſerpents, &amp;c.</hi> It is accounted a great part of wiſdome in the Serpent to preſerve his head with all the care that may be, becauſe all his life lyes in his head: a little blow on the head quickly kills him, but wound him never ſo much on the body (his head being ſafe) he will recover it againe. Now the Apoſtle tels us, that <hi>our life is hid with God, in Chriſt our head,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coloſ. 3.3.</note> in whom we muſt bee carefull to preſerve, and keepe our Faith, though wee ſuffer never ſo many wounds in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, goods, or good names, Reſolving with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, that <hi>neither tribulation, nor anguiſh, nor perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. ſhall bee able to ſeparate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord. Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, to the <hi>Stewards wiſdome,</hi> the wiſdome of Prevention. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.8. <hi>The Lord commended the unjuſt Steward, becauſe hee had done wiſely, &amp;c.</hi> The Steward we know, being ready to bee put from his place, to prevent poverty, made himſelſe friends with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſters goods, which was reputed a point of wiſdome in him. Now wee are all but Stewards of what wee poſſeſſe, and know not how ſoone we ſhall bee taken from them, or they from us: Here then is our wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45717:16"/>in time to make us friends with theſe <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of unrighteouſnes</hi> (for ſo Chriſt calls theſe earthly riches in compariſon of the true treaſure) that when they ſayle us,<note place="margin">Luke 16.9.</note> we may be <hi>received into everlaſting habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations:</hi> which may bee beſt done by our Charity to the poore members of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for,<note place="margin">Prov. 19.17.</note> 
               <hi>what we give to the poore, we lend to the Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon,</hi> and <hi>what is layd out, he will repay us againe.</hi> The poore mans hand is the rich mans reaſury, what hee layes up there, he ſhall find in heaven: hee that feeds the hungry, puts bread into <hi>Chriſts</hi> owne mouth; hee that clothes the naked, puts a garment on <hi>Christs</hi> owne backe; and hee that gives to the poore, puts a penny in <hi>Chriſts</hi> owne hand; himſelfe hath ſaid it,<note place="margin">Matth 25.45. Eccl. 11 7.</note> 
               <hi>whatſoever you doe unto any of theſe little ones, yee doe it unto me. Caſt your bread then upon theſe waters, and after many dayes you ſhall find it</hi> againe with a great reward.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, to the <hi>Ants wiſdome,</hi> the wiſdome of Providence. <hi>Proverb.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Goe to the Ant thou ſluggard, conſider her wayes and bee wiſe.</hi> It is obſerved of the Ant that ſhe labours very painefully in the Summer to get proviſion together to keepe her in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: ſo ſhould wee doe, during the ſummer of health, and proſperity, and Sunne-ſhine of the Goſpell of peace,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.19.</note> lay up for our ſelves a good foundation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Winter of trouble, need, ſorrow, ſickneſſe or other adverſity: The Apoſtles Counſell is,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.10.</note> 
               <hi>while you have time doe good to all, eſpecially to thoſe who are of the houſhold of Faith:</hi> and the Prophet renders you a reaſon of it, becauſe in death God is not remembred,<note place="margin">Pſal 6.5.</note> 
               <hi>nor will any give him thanks in the grave,</hi> while you have the light walk,<note place="margin">Iohn. 11. Phil. 2.12.</note> and <hi>while it is called to day worke out your
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45717:17"/>ſalvation with feare and trembling,</hi> preſerve with <hi>Moſes</hi> a pot of heavenly Manna, in the Arke of your hearts, and provide with <hi>Ioſeph</hi> a ſtore-houſe of ſpirituall food in your ſoules, that you may live and not dye, if God ſhould withhold you from the benefit of his publicke Ordinances.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, to the <hi>Sydonians wiſdom,</hi> the wiſdom of Peace, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.20. It is reputed a great point of wiſdome in them of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sydon,</hi> that having highly diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed King <hi>Herod,</hi> they came with one accord, and <hi>having made Blaſtus the Kings Chamberlaine their friend deſired Peace, becauſe their Countrey was nouriſhed by the Kings Countrey:</hi> Let it be our care to goe, and doe likewiſe: wee have highly offended the great King of Heaven and Earth by our manifold ſinnes and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, having ſo long turned his grace into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe, that we have now juſt cauſe to feare, he will turne our peace into warre: withall wee know it is not for us to ſtrive with our maker, for wee are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by him, by him wee live and move and have our being. Here then is our wiſdome, to make <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> the Kings Sonne our friend:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.19.</note> let us by timely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and faith reconcile our ſelves unto him, and he will reconcile us to his Father.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, to <hi>Davids wiſdome,</hi> the wiſdome of Piety, Pſalme 119.98. <hi>I have more wiſdome then my teachers, becauſe I keepe thy Commandements,</hi> The old word for righteouſneſſe is right wiſeneſſe, and it is a good one, for the righteous man is the right wiſe man. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>how can they be wiſe</hi> ſayes <hi>Ieremy, ſince they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the law of their God:</hi> you may ſee it in <hi>Achitophel,</hi> his great wiſdome unſanctified turned to his deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45717:17"/>In the fourth of Deuteronomy the 6. <hi>Moſes</hi> there tells <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that the keeping of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements would be their Wiſdome in the ſight of the people, and their obſervance of his Statuts, would get them ſuch renowne, that <hi>all the Nations round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout would ſay, ſurely this great Nation is a wiſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding people.</hi> I have read of one who towards his end ſequeſtring himſelfe from the cares, and affaires of the world, and betaking him to a religious courſe of life; a friend of his, after ſome time coming to viſit him, would needs know of him, how (being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettered as hee was) hee could poſſibly ſpend his time in that ſolitude, to whom hee replied, that ſince hee had devoted himſelfe to that way, he had learnt three letters, which tooke up his whole time. The firſt hee ſaid, was a Blacke letter, and that put him in mind of his ſinnes, and ſome of his time hee ſpent here in ſorrowing and bewayling his tranſgreſſions, and repenting for them. The ſecond was a Red letter, and this minded him of the Paſſion and ſufferings of his Saviour, which, while he laboured by Faith, to apply to himſelfe, did employ another part of his time: and the third, was a Golden letter, which remembred him with the joyes of Heaven, and the happineſſe of Gods Elect, after this life; and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of this, tooke up the reſt of his thoughts. And indeed, hee that hath learnt theſe three letters well, is a good Scholler, though he have learned no more, for by theſe, he ſhall learne to feare God, and <hi>the feare of God,</hi> ſayes <hi>David, is the beginning of wiſdome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſ. ni. 10.</note> yea, and the end too,<note place="margin">Eccl. 12.13.</note> for <hi>Salomons</hi> tells us to <hi>feare God, and to keepe his Commandments, is the whole duty of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45717:18"/>man.</hi> With this then will I end the Text; and bleſſed ſhall wee bee if wee can all of us ſo end our time; <hi>viz.</hi> in the feare of God, which that wee may the better doe, I pray for my ſelfe, and you; as <hi>Moſes</hi> for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and <hi>Iſrael; Lord ſo teach us to number our dayes, that we may apply our hearts unto Wiſdome. Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus having done with my Text, I ſuppoſe it may bee in the next place expected that I ſhould in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular adde ſomething of the party, for whoſe ſake and for yours this Sermon is compoſed.

            <p>She received the ſentence of death within her ſelfe, long before the execution thereof, by meanes of a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45717:19"/>lingring Conſumption, ſent from her heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſame Meſſage that the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> brought to <hi>Hezekiah; Set thy houſe in order,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Kin. 20.1.</note> 
               <hi>for thou muſt dye,</hi> whereby her ſtrength daily decaying, and (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the good uſe of all lawful meanes poſſible for prevention) the glaſſe of her life being well nigh run out; thoſe motions of grace that were in her (like thoſe of nature) became now <hi>In fine velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciores</hi> more quicke and lively towards her end, mounting up her ſoule on a ſwifter wing towards her happineſſe: the Spirit of God did now fill the ſayles of her affections, with more then an extraordinary deſire of her wiſhed-for heaven.</p>
            <p>But Satan envying that ſo fure a veſſell ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the Port without a ſtorme raiſed; a ſudden tempeſt of doubts, and diſtruſtfull thoughts in her ſoule, labouring thereby (had it beene poſſible) to wracke her faith upon the rocke of deſpaire, and God (willing to ſhew his ſtrength in her weakeneſſe) ſuffers for a time this Eclipſe of his wonted preſence, being delighted to ſee her (with the Diſciples) row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and towing againſt the ſtreames of Satans temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, whilſt himſelfe (with our Saviour) walkes by on the waves, ready to ſuccour her in the greateſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</p>
            <p>During which weakeneſſe, both of mind and body, her ſorrowfull husband with other her choice friends (who ſincerely loved her) being deſirous to comply with any courſe which might be thought conducible to her welfare, upon good adviſe her deſire brought her on Tueſday the 14 day of <hi>Iuly</hi> laſt paſt from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> towards <hi>Pluckley</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> the reſidence of her
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45717:20"/>huſbands (and truely alſo) of her deareſt and moſt tenderly affected kindred and friends.</p>
            <p>Now as ſhe was travelling upon the way, there hapned unto her (as to <hi>Iacob</hi> in his journey from <hi>Padan-Aram</hi> to <hi>Canaan</hi>) a grievous wreſtling,<note place="margin">Gen. 32.24.</note> with a fore and heavy conflict, which cauſed her for the time (like him) to halt very much, not on her feet, but in her affections, beginning now extreamely to complaine of her want of faith, and to doubt of the aſſurance of her ſalvation, in both which before-time ſhe lived fully confirmed, and this tryall was ſo full of trouble to her ſelfe, and griefe to her loving huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and friends then in company, that they were neceſſitated for that to night lodge her and themſelves ſhort of that place whither they intended; where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving repoſed her body with all ſit accommodation, their chiefe care was how to compoſe her doubts, and to comfort her weake and feeble mind: and to this end they requeſted my aſſiſtance (the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy paſtor of that place where then ſhe reſted) and (conſidering the office required, to be in it ſelfe both Chriſtian and charitable, and an eſſentiall part of my Miniſteriall charge, to ſupport the weake, <hi>And to bind up the broken hearted</hi>) I was gladly entreated to aſſiſt with the beſt counſels that lay in me, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhing of her peace.</p>
            <p>Being come unto her ſhe began to repeate unto me her former complaints, accuſing her ſelfe of a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull dulneſſe, and deadneſſe of heart; of a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous want of faith, that ſhe could not apply the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts of God to her ſoule, nor repent as ſhe ought for her ſins; that ſhe could not feele the comfortable
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45717:20"/>preſence of Gods Spirit, as ſhe was wont, that ſhe had no mind to ſue unto him by prayer as before; and thereupon concludes againſt her ſelfe, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Lord had forſaken her, and caſt her off; and would not reſtore her to the joy of his ſalvation: which words, ſhe uttered with many ſighs and groanes, with ſtrong cryings, which argued truely the anguiſh and diſtreſſe of her ſoule. Whereupon ſorrowing to behold her in this extremity of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: (for as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, the ſpirit of a man will ſuſtaine his infirmity, <hi>But a wounded ſpirit who can beare?</hi> Proverb. 18.14.)</p>
            <p>I addreſt my ſelfe to apply unto her what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort God ſhould enable meto Miniſter: Aſſuring her that theſe ſpirituall deſertions for a time are famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, to the deareſt of Gods Children; inſtancing in <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Iob,</hi> and in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> with other Saints, whoſe particular tryals I dilated unto her, adding moreover that God like a wiſe Father, is not alwayes kiſsing his ſons, but many times correcting of them; and that his love in their humiliation, is as much mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyed towards them, by the ſaving effects of it, as is his mercy in their exaltation. I told her farther that the ſenſe of her weakeneſſe which ſhe complained of, was not weakeneſſe, but ſtrength; for it comes not from our corruption, that we feele our corruption, but from Gods grace, and that the deteſtation of ſin, with a deſire to repent; is true repentance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and a manifeſt worke of the ſpirit; and though God find many things in us that he likes not, yet he ever loves and likes this in us, that we doe diſlike and loath our ſelves; for God reſpects not ſo much our
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45717:21"/>ſtate, as our purpoſe, nor regards ſo much what we are, as what we deſire to be. For a deſire to be good, is a good ſtep to, yea a good part of goodneſſe it ſelf: I prayd her therefore, not to wrong her ſelfe ſo much, as to imagine ſhe could not repent, while ſhe profeſt ſhe hated ſin, and deſired to repent; nor to offer that indignity to Gods mercy, as to feare he ſhould be unwilling to forgive and pardon, what ſhe was ſo willing to forgoe and part withall.</p>
            <p>I ſhewed her alſo concerning her want of faith, and ſpirituall feeling, how that though God might ſuffer her faith to faint, yet would he never ſuffer it to faile: and that it is the firmeſt faith, which beleeves without feeling, when a man can ſay with <hi>Iob, though he kill me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob 13.15.</note> 
               <hi>yet will I truſt in him.</hi> For our owne feeling is no fit judge of faith, for that is often overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with temptations, but faith muſt be judged of by the word of God: Now the word tells us, that faith is not alwayes a burning Lampe, but ſomtimes, yea often a ſmoaking Flax,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.20.</note> which is ſo weake that it ſends out neither heat nor flame, but only a ſmoake, and yet will not the Lord quench this ſmall ſparke of faith, neither can it periſh being begotten of immortall ſeed, <hi>viz.</hi> the word of God which endures for ever.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.23.</note> Againe we know, <hi>Magis et minus non mutant ſpeciem,</hi> a little or a ſicke man is a man as well as a great or a ſound one, &amp; a foule and a feeble hand may receive an Almes, as well as a faire and ſtrong one, ſo little and weake faith is faith, as well as that which is great and firme, and the one may as truely apply Chriſt as the other: For we doe not imagine that faith doth juſtifie us, becauſe it is a ſtrong and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45717:21"/>vertue, but it juſtifies us, for the object which it apprehends, that is, Chriſt the Mediator. Nor are we ſo much to conclude of faith from the firme per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion it works in us; as from the reſting and rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby, on the merits of Chriſt for ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Moreover I laboured to poſſeſſe her with this truth, that God can be no more ſaid, to forſake his Servants, when for a time he hides away his face, then the Sun can be ſaid to be ſet, when it is but under a cloud: for howſoever the ſenſible preſence of Gods Spirit, (whereby he makes his Children to feel him, by the gracious effects which he workes in them) be ſubject to changes and Eclipſes; yet the ſecret pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Spirit, never departs from them, but is continually ruling, guiding, and ſuſtaining them in all their troubles, according to his promiſe in the old Teſtament, <hi>Eſay</hi> 43.2. and in the New, <hi>Math.</hi> 28.20. Yea, by vertue of this ſecret preſence, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaines life in our ſoules, when to our owne judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we are become altogether dead and ſenſeleſſe; as there is life and ſap in a tree, when it hath neither fruit nor leaves, which is evident by our ſtanding in many temptations, wherein we could find no preſent grace upholding us. For had we our happineſſe in our owne hands (as once we had) we could not be able to hold out againſt the leaſt of Satans aſſaults, but that he muſt needs deprive us of it: but God ſeeing what bad keepers we are of our owne Jewels, hath tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the cuſtody of them unto Chriſt, and hung the keyes at his girdle, by whom they are ſo ſafely kept for us,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.4.5.</note> and we for them (as ſaith S. <hi>Peter</hi>) that now the leaſt ſparke of ſaving-grace in any beleever, is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45717:22"/>more then all the power of Hell is able to quench.</p>
            <p>Thus having ſpent ſome time with her by enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging theſe, and adding many other comforts out of the Scripture, which need not here to be repeated, (endeavouring in what I could, to ſatisfie her in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very doubt) &amp; perceiving a great part of her diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be occaſioned from the weakeneſſe of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the wearyneſſe of her ſpirits, and the want of reſt, I tooke my leave of her for that time; not without this acknowledgement of comfort from her ſelfe, that ſhe hoped I had done her ſome good; promiſing (at the intreating of her friends) to viſit her againe within few dayes, at the houſe of the worthy Lady <hi>Dering,</hi> the now ſorrowing mother of this Gentlewoman, whither the next day ſhe was removed: which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly I did the fryday following; and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that she with her had bindiſcourſing, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before my comming, and her entirely loving Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the right Worſhipfull Sir <hi>Edward Dering,</hi> (whoſe obſervation of her was this, that thoſe doubts and feares whereof ſhe complained, proceeded not ſo much from any ſinfull cauſe occaſioned by her ſelfe, whereof ſhe could accuſe her ſelfe, as from an over-earneſt, &amp; longing deſire of more ſpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and illumination, then God was pleaſed for the preſent to make her ſenſible of; as afterward it more cleerely appeared): unwilling then to tire her enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſpirits with too much talke together; I ſtayd a while before I ſaw her. Then being brought into her Chamber, ſhe told me ſhe much rejoyced at my comming, being perſwaded that ſhe ſhould reape comfort by my diſcourſe, and was minded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45717:22"/>me to pray with her, whereunto then ſhe had a great deſire, but the continuance of theſe good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (ſhe ſaid) was ſo ſhort, that before ſhe could call for me they were gone, and ſhe re-poſſeſt ſo with her former doubts and feares, that now ſhe had no heart thereto; whereupon I replyed that I made no queſtion but that theſe good motions would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne again: In the mean time ſhe might hereby take notice of Gods Method with his deareſt Children, ſometimes raviſhing them with S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.4.</note> as it were into the third heavens, by filling their ſoules with unſpeakeable joy and gladneſſe; ſometimes againe (with the ſame Apoſtle) humbling them as it were to hell, by caſting his angry countenance upon them, &amp; ſuffering ſatan alſo to buffet them, yet making them gainers both by his comming to them, and his going from them; for by the one they gaine comfort againſt deſpaire, by the other warning againſt perſumption; therefore as ſhe ought, when ſhe felt thoſe heavenly Motions in her heart, to cheriſh them; ſo when ſhe felt them not, she ought not to think her ſelf contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Withall I ſhewed her that it is the endeavour of many beleevers, ſo eagerly to purſue after more grace, as that they deny themſelves the comfortable uſe of what they have; like many worldlings, who having a competent portion of earthly things in the eye of others, yet repine as if they had nothing, becauſe they have not ſo much as themſelves deſire: wherfore I beſought her, as to remember carefully to ſeeke for more; ſo not to forget thankefully to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge what ſhe had; which was the onely way to invite God, to conferre upon her a larger mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45717:23"/>of Spirituall conſolation.</p>
            <p>I then offered unto her the aſſiſtance of my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which ſhe imbraced, and while we were intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the throne of grace on her behalfe, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of Gods favourable preſence, and the light of his countenance upon her, and that he would againe reſtore her to the joy of his ſalvation <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I applyed unto her that petition of <hi>David,</hi> Lord comfort the ſoule of thy Servant, for in thee hath ſhe put her truſt; which words were no ſooner uttered, but ſhe cryed with a loud voice, ô that I was aſſured that I am thy Servant! and that I could truſt in thee as I ought, then ſhould my ſoule be comforted indeed.</p>
            <p>This done, inſiſting ſome while in directing her how ſhe might purchaſe that aſſurance, and that truſt ſhe ſo heartily prayd for, I left her untill the Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day after.</p>
            <p>By which time the Sun of righteouſneſſe with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in his wings (having diſpelled in good meaſure thoſe myſts of diffidence which eclipſed the light, and peace of her ſoule) began againe to ſhine forth in his wonted cleereneſſe, reviving and cheering up thoſe drooping affections which had ſo long languiſhed in the want of his comfortable preſence, inſomuch that (to my great rejoycing) <hi>I</hi> found her magnifying of mercy which before ſhe doubted of, and comforting her ſelfe with thoſe Scriptures, which before her ſoule refuſed comfort in, being tendred unto her. <hi>I</hi> told her <hi>I</hi> did heartily bleſſe God for this happy change in her: and ſhe replyed, that the <hi>grace of Chriſt was ſufficient</hi> for her, upon whom ſhe did wholly reſt and rely for her ſalvation, diſclayming all conceipt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45717:23"/>of worth, or merit in her ſelfe; entreating me to pray to God for her, that it would pleaſe him to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thoſe diſtruſtfull thoughts which ſhe had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly of his goodneſſe, and to perfect that re-aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his love in her heart; ſhe joyning with us very cheerefully, and devoutly all the time, expreſſing a marvelous longing for the fullneſſe of ſpiritual and heavenly joy. Inſomuch that while I inſerted that peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prophet, <hi>Doe well unto thy Servant, that ſhe may live, and praiſe thy name;</hi> ſhe interrupted me ſaying, ô pray onely for my ſoule, for <hi>I deſire to be diſsolved, and to be with Chriſt,</hi> which is farre better.</p>
            <p>The Sunday following in the afternoone, <hi>I</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted, to preach to the Congregation of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, whither being come, and enquiring of her health, <hi>I</hi> was generally aſſured that they had obſerved her to be that day more compoſed &amp; cheerefull, then uſually ſhe had bin; but while the whol Families of her friends were Religiouſly exerciſed in the Church, ſhe inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to thoſe that wayted about her, that ſhe felt her ſelfe ſenſibly to change, (her Cough having a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before left her, a ſure ſigne in thoſe diſeaſes of death approaching, whereupon they asked her if they ſhould call the Lady her mother, or husband, or any other unto her? but ſhe anſwerd no, they were (ſhe ſaid) about a good worke, and ſhe hoped that ſhe ſhould live till they had done; and God granted her requeſt, for no ſooner was the Sermon ended, and all her friends againe returned about her, but ſhe heartily wiſhed for ſome one, to recommend her ſoule to God: it was my happineſſe to be there at that time, and they entreated mee to performe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45717:24"/>that laſt office for her, which we haſted to doe, perceiving her to decline apace, while ſhe (to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of all that were preſent, conſidering her great weakeneſſe) repeated after me very zealouſly almoſt what ſoever I delivered, and concluding with the Lords Prayer, ſhe moſt devoutly rehearſed that word for word, which as it was the firſt ſhe learnt, ſo <hi>I</hi> may truely ſay it was the laſt ſhe uttered; for imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately hereupon, (as if ſhe had onely ſtaid for this Convoy to her eternall reſt) ſhe moſt ſweetly and peaceably exchanged this life, leaving her ſurviving friends (like the Apoſtle) in a ſtrait betwixt two, not knowing which to chuſe, whether more to mourne for her loſſe, or to rejoyce for her ſo bleſſed and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie departure.</p>
            <p>But why doe <hi>I</hi> ſpeake of loſſe, (ſince to uſe Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> phraſe) to her to live was Chriſt, and to dye was gaine, for she is not <hi>amiſsa,</hi> but <hi>praemiſsa,</hi> not loſt, but gone before; death to her, being but like <hi>Iordan</hi> to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a waftage from the wilderneſſe of this world, to the Canaan of everlaſting bleſſednes: wher her ſoul is bound up in the bundle of life ſecurely repoſed in the boſom of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
